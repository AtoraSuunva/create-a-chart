# Create-a-Chart

> Create scatter charts using a SPA

I wanted something that could be used to make a scatter chart because I wanted to make a meme. Here's the app I spent too long working on.

![Preview of the App](/preview/preview.png)

# Features
 - Tons of customization!
 - Changes render instantly live!
 - Entry labels readjust themselves automatically!
 - Renders to canvases (easy to save)!
 - (Mostly) responsive!
 - Something like 13KB compressed!

# Not-Features
These are things that may or may not ever be finished, depending on if I get time
 - No mobile support (both no touch support and it resizes badly on small screens)
 - Can't change the size of the entry dots
 - The app looks kinda ugly but it's functional enough
 - The code is undocumented and fairly messy, since I don't plan on maintaining this more than a short time

# Built With
 - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
 - [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
 - [zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand)

Also massive shoutout to [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) & everyone who's worked on it
